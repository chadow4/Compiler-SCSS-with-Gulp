# Compiler-SCSS-with-Gulp

This is a Scss compiler template using GULP.

**Getting started :**

- Install Gulp on your computer with the command : ```npm i --global gulp-cli``` .

- The template is pre-configured with the different dependencies needed, but you can still the command ```npm install``` to ensure that all dependencies settle in well.

- Once this is done, all you have to do is the command:  ```gulp watch```.
  
  - This command will follow all your changes and automatically compile your SCSS into CSS.
  
  - You will need to do this each time you start your editor.

**If there is an execution error :**

- Go into your powershell and enter the command : ```Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser -Force```.
  
  - This command allows to running all local scripts on your computer.
